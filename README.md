WARNING VERY ROUGH FIRST DRAFT VERSION:

eventually you get to generate labyrinth-text.
currently produced image goes to my desktop /home/kas/Desktop. 
Unless you are me you should change that.
Lots of things are currently hardcoded.

Labyrinth generation is currently kept in bounds.
0's are considered walls that can be dug into
1's are considered outer boundaries
2's are considered as path

TODO:
*Remove hardcoded things
*Generate big-grid letters from text
*Unit tests
*Fuse labyrinthletters to each other to form a complete labyrinth
